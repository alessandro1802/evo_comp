# Own method

The goal of this assignment is to improve the algorithms that were implemented earlier. 
Either a modification of previously implemented algorithms or a completely new method should be proposed to improve the average score and the best result obtained in previous experiments (on all instances) at the same time. 
The new algorithm needs to be described in detail. 
For example, mechanisms such as:
- generating better starting solutions,
- further improvements of the efficiency of local searches.
- global memory of moves evaluations,
- new mechanisms of candidate moves;
- other operators of neighborhood, perturbation, recombination,
- simultaneous use of different operators,
- use of machine learning mechanisms,
- ...

The proposed method should be precisely described and its algorithm should be provided in pseudocode.
