# Greedy regret heuristics

Implement two methods based on greedy cycle heuristic:

- Greedy 2-regret heuristics.
- Greedy heuristics with a weighted sum criterion â€“ 2-regret + best change of the objective function.
By default use equal weights but you can also experiment with other values.

The structure of the report should be the same as previously. Please include in the summary of results please include results of the previous methods.
